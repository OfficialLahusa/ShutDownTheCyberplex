## Building
The project can built from source using BlueJ. Alternatively a compiled release is available on the project's GitHub repository.
Run using:  
`java --module-path "C:\Program Files\BlueJ\lib\javafx\lib" --add-modules javafx.swing,javafx.media -jar ShutDownTheCyberplex.jar`  
The module path can be substituted for any other valid **JavaFX** (https://openjfx.io/) install location, it currently refers to the default location of BlueJ's included javafx library (as of version 5.0.2).
